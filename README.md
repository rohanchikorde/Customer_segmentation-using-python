# Customer_segmentation-using-python

This project deals with the division of Customers into discrete customer group that
share similar charachteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unmet customer needs. 
Companies that identify underserved segments can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services 
Customer Segmentation is most effective when a company tailors offerings to segments that are the most profitable and serves them with distinct competitive advantages. 


How Customer Segmentation works:

Customer Segmentation requires managers to:

-Divide the market into meaningful and measurable segments according to customers' needs, their past behaviors or their demographic profiles
-Determine the profit potential of each segment by analyzing the revenue and cost impacts of serving each segment

-Target segments according to their profit potential and the company's ability to serve them in a proprietary way

-Invest resources to tailor product, service, marketing and distribution programs to match the needs of each target segment

-Measure performance of each segment and adjust the segmentation approach over time as market conditions change decision making throughout the organization
